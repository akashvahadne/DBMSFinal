      Check the number of days (from date of issue). If days are between 15 to 30 then fine amount will be Rs 5 per day. If no. of days &gt; 30, per day fine will be Rs 50 per day and for days less than 30, Rs. 5 per day. After submitting the book, status will change from I to R. If condition of fine is true, then details will be stored into Fine table. Also handles the exception by named exception handler or user defined exception handler.</td>
