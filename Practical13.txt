External Viva sathi answer:
When the examiner asks:
    “How will you run or show this practical?”

You should say:
“Sir/Ma’am, JSON is a text-based data format. We usually demonstrate it by writing valid JSON structure in an editor like VS Code, Online JSON Viewer, or MongoDB Compass. It doesn’t execute like SQL — it represents structured data.”

Then, you can:
Open VS Code / Notepad / Online JSON Viewer
Paste your JSON code
Show that the structure is valid and formatted properly.

✅ That’s enough to “run” it.
