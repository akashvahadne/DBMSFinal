🧩 Practical 9: Study of Open Source NoSQL Database — MongoDB

(Installation, Basic CRUD Operations, and Execution)

🎯 Aim

To study and perform installation and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the MongoDB NoSQL database.

⚙️ Step 1: Installation of MongoDB
🪟 For Windows:

Download MongoDB from the official website:
👉 https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

Install it using the setup wizard.

During setup, select ✅ Install MongoDB as a Service.

Once installed, MongoDB is available at:

C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\<version>\bin


Add this path to your Environment Variables → Path.

💻 Step 2: Verify Installation

Open Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell and type:

mongosh


If MongoDB is installed correctly, you will see:

Using MongoDB: 8.x.x
Using Mongosh: 2.x.x
test>


✅ You are now inside the Mongo Shell.

🧱 Step 3: Create Database and Collection
Create a new database:
use collegeDB

Create a collection:
db.createCollection("students")


✅ Output:

{ "ok" : 1 }

🧾 Step 4: Perform Basic CRUD Operations
➕ CREATE (Insert Data)
db.students.insertMany([
  { roll_no: 1, name: "Akash", dept: "Computer", city: "Nashik", marks: 85 },
  { roll_no: 2, name: "Neha", dept: "IT", city: "Pune", marks: 92 },
  { roll_no: 3, name: "Rohan", dept: "ENTC", city: "Mumbai", marks: 78 },
  { roll_no: 4, name: "Meera", dept: "Computer", city: "Nashik", marks: 88 },
  { roll_no: 5, name: "Saurabh", dept: "IT", city: "Nagpur", marks: 70 }
])


✅ Output:

Acknowledged: true
Inserted 5 documents

🔍 READ (Find Data)
Show all students:
db.students.find()

Show students with marks greater than 80:
db.students.find({ marks: { $gt: 80 } })

Show students from "Nashik":
db.students.find({ city: "Nashik" })

✏️ UPDATE (Modify Data)
Update a single record:
db.students.updateOne(
  { roll_no: 3 },
  { $set: { marks: 82, city: "Aurangabad" } }
)

Update multiple records:
db.students.updateMany(
  { dept: "IT" },
  { $inc: { marks: 5 } }
)


✅ The $set operator modifies specific fields,
✅ The $inc operator increments numerical values.

🗑️ DELETE (Remove Data)
Delete one record:
db.students.deleteOne({ roll_no: 5 })

Delete multiple records:
db.students.deleteMany({ city: "Nashik" })

🧠 Step 5: Understanding MongoDB Structure
Concept	Equivalent In SQL	Description
Database	Database	A logical container for collections
Collection	Table	Stores documents
Document	Row	A JSON-like record
Field	Column	Key-value pair inside a document
⚡ Step 6: Execute CRUD Using MongoDB Compass

If using MongoDB Compass (GUI tool):

Open MongoDB Compass

Connect using:

mongodb://localhost:27017


Create a new Database:
Database name: collegeDB
Collection name: students

Perform CRUD using GUI buttons:

Insert Document → Add new student

Filter Box → Search / Read

UPDATE / DELETE buttons → Modify or remove data

✅ Result

MongoDB was successfully installed, configured, and basic CRUD operations were executed using:

Mongo Shell (CLI)

MongoDB Compass (GUI)

🧾 Output Example (Final Data in Collection)
[
  { "roll_no": 1, "name": "Akash", "dept": "Computer", "city": "Nashik", "marks": 85 },
  { "roll_no": 2, "name": "Neha", "dept": "IT", "city": "Pune", "marks": 97 },
  { "roll_no": 3, "name": "Rohan", "dept": "ENTC", "city": "Aurangabad", "marks": 82 },
  { "roll_no": 4, "name": "Meera", "dept": "Computer", "city": "Nashik", "marks": 88 }
]

🎓 Conclusion

MongoDB, a NoSQL open-source database, was successfully installed and demonstrated using CRUD operations for managing student records. The experiment shows how MongoDB stores data in flexible JSON-like documents instead of rigid tables.
