🧩 PRACTICAL 10 — Step-by-Step Execution Guide
🎯 Aim
To perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
and use the SAVE method and logical operators in MongoDB.

🧱 Step 1: Create Database and Collection
Open MongoDB Compass.
Click on ➕ Create Database
Enter:
Database Name: collegeDB
Collection Name: students
Click Create Database ✅

🧾 Step 2: Insert Documents (CREATE Operation)
Now click on collegeDB → students → ADD DATA → Insert Document
Paste this code and click Insert 👇
[
  { "roll_no": 1, "name": "Akash", "dept": "Computer", "city": "Nashik", "marks": 85 },
  { "roll_no": 2, "name": "Neha", "dept": "IT", "city": "Pune", "marks": 92 },
  { "roll_no": 3, "name": "Rohan", "dept": "ENTC", "city": "Mumbai", "marks": 78 },
  { "roll_no": 4, "name": "Meera", "dept": "Computer", "city": "Nashik", "marks": 88 },
  { "roll_no": 5, "name": "Saurabh", "dept": "IT", "city": "Nagpur", "marks": 70 }
]

✅ You have now inserted multiple documents into the collection.

🔍 Step 3: Retrieve Data (READ Operation)
a) Show all students
In the Filter box, type:
{}

Click Find
👉 Displays all students.

b) Show students with marks greater than 80
{ "marks": { "$gt": 80 } }

c) Show students from Nashik city
{ "city": "Nashik" }

d) Show students from Computer OR IT department
(Logical Operator $or)
{ "$or": [ { "dept": "Computer" }, { "dept": "IT" } ] }

e) Show students with marks between 75 and 90
(Logical Operator $and)
{ "$and": [ { "marks": { "$gte": 75 } }, { "marks": { "$lte": 90 } } ] }

✏️ Step 4: Update Data (UPDATE Operation)
Click on UPDATE or run this query in mongosh:
db.students.updateOne(
  { "roll_no": 3 },
  { "$set": { "marks": 82, "city": "Aurangabad" } }
)

👉 This updates Rohan’s marks and city.

You can also update many records at once:
db.students.updateMany(
  { "dept": "IT" },
  { "$inc": { "marks": 5 } }
)


👉 Adds 5 marks to all IT students.

🗑️ Step 5: Delete Data (DELETE Operation)
To delete a specific record:
db.students.deleteOne({ "roll_no": 5 })

To delete all students from a city:
db.students.deleteMany({ "city": "Nashik" })

💾 Step 6: SAVE Method (Insert or Update Automatically)
MongoDB’s save() method will insert a new document
if it doesn’t exist, or update it if it does exist.

db.students.save({ "roll_no": 6, "name": "Priya", "dept": "AI", "city": "Pune", "marks": 95 })

👉 Adds a new student if roll_no = 6 doesn’t exist.
👉 If it exists, updates that record.

🧠 Step 7: Use of Logical Operators
Operator	Description	Example
$and	Returns documents that match both conditions	{ "$and": [ { "dept": "IT" }, { "marks": { "$gt": 80 } } ] }
$or	Returns documents that match either condition	{ "$or": [ { "city": "Pune" }, { "city": "Nashik" } ] }
$not	Returns documents that do not match a condition	{ "marks": { "$not": { "$gte": 80 } } }
$nor	Returns documents that fail all conditions	{ "$nor": [ { "dept": "IT" }, { "dept": "Computer" } ] }
📋 Step 8: Verify All Documents

To confirm final data, run:
{}

and click Find again — this will show the updated collection.

🏁 Step 9: Result
✅ You have successfully demonstrated all CRUD operations:

Create → insertMany()
Read → find() with conditions and logical operators
Update → updateOne() / updateMany()
Delete → deleteOne() / deleteMany()
Save → save() (insert or update)
